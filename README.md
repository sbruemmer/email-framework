# Gulp Email Framework

A simple, gulp powered framework to develop and test responsive emails. Inspired by [Gulp Email Creator](https://github.com/darylldoyle/Gulp-Email-Creator) and the [Grunt Email Workflow](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow).

## Installation

Clone this repository to a local folder and run:
```
npm install
```

## Features

### A basic starter template
This framework comes with a ready to use sample start template, which can be modified how you like it. All the used example assets are Â©Mailchimp.

### Automatic CSS Inline and build system
The build systems inlines all the css autmaticly, but keeps your media queries in the head tag, so the build email is ready to be used in any service.

### No more reloading thanks to browser sync
Browser sync is keeping all the adjustments you make to the email templates in sync and previews changes live, without manually reloading.

### Smart partials
We are using gulp-file-include for includes, giving you the option to pass down props to partials like so
```
@@include('./var.html', {
  "name": "haoxin",
  "age": 12345,
  "socials": {
    "fb": "facebook.com/include",
    "tw": "twitter.com/include"
})
```

### Sending test emails via Mailgun and Mandrill
Use Mailgun to send preview emails to yourself using `gulp send` (please adjust the setting in the gulp file to the template you want to send). Or if you have an Mandrill you can send the email you are previewing right from the UI.

### A simple UI for designing your emails
Preview and manage all your templates right from the UI and preview your email at two devices sizes at the same time, browser sync will keep all the iFrames in sync for you.

## How to use
Rename the `config-sample.json` file to `config.json`. Add you api keys for mailgun and mandrill, if you want to use either of the service for sending test emails to yourself. Setting up an mailgun account for that is free, but it doesn't support sending emails from the UI.

```
{
  "testing": {
    "from": "from-email",
    "to": "recepit-email",
    "subject": "your-subject-line"
  },

  "auth": {
    "mailgun": {
      "apikey": "your-api-key",
      "sandbox": "your-sandbox-url"
    },
    "mandrill": {
      "apikey": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}

```

Run the framework by using
```
gulp
```
Now edit the template in
```
src/templates/basic-template.html
```
or create your own from scratch. As long as the gulp task is running it will automaticly build the template on every save and reload the browser.

Pull request and feedback welcome, as this is a very first version.
Thanks a lot [Filip](https://github.com/peritus) for helping my with lots of the JS part.
